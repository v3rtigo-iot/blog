Hello there! I'm Nathan. To foster discourse, collaboration and ensure I take good notes for myself, I've created blog to document the journey into the world of IoT/Hardware hacking. It's super exciting to think of sharing this content and have you all along as we go through the trials and tribulations of learning a complex topic. Join me as we hack some hardware and dive into interesting vulnerabilities and realities of the hardware we all use every day and continue to become more prolific.
