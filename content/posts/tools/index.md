We'll begin our journey with a look at essential tools needed to begin basic analysis of IoT devices. Once we've discussed the basics, we'll move into those that add to quality of life and finally tools for more advanced hardware analysis.

This is by no means an exhaustive list nor are these in a strict order of importance.  That said, all the tools in this initial group are arguably all necessary for the basic analysis deep dives we'll do as the blog progresses. 

It's worth noting that you don't need the exact same brand of tools.  As far as cost, while I didn't purchases the cheapest of everything, I tried to keep costs reasonable as things can add up fast.

# So what is all this stuff?

Now that we have an idea of what we'll need, let's describe at a high level what they are and what they do.

*Safety Considerations: Itâ€™s vital to follow proper safety guidelines, such as using the correct range and terminal for any measurement being taken. Improper use can lead to damage to the tool or even injury.*

***Multimeter***
A multimeter is an invaluable tool for anyone working with electronics or electrical systems. It can measure several different aspects related to electricity, such as voltage, current, resistance, and sometimes other quantities like capacitance and temperature. In general, the multimeter will be the first tool we use to identify, specifically, **ground** and **voltage**.
