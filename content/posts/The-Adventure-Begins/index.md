Hello there! I'm Nathan. To foster discourse, collaboration and ensure I take good notes for myself, I've created blog to document the journey into the world of IoT/Hardware hacking. It's super exciting to share this content and have you all along as we go through the trials and tribulations of learning a complex topic. Join me as we hack some hardware and dive into interesting vulnerabilities and realities of the hardware we all use every day and that continues to become more prolific.   

There's a very important point I'd like to mention.  The learning curve will hit hard.  Taking our time and establishing a solid foundation is critical to continuing the journey in such a way that we are effectively learning and not just wasting time.  This field is multifaceted and will require depth of knowledge in many realms. E.g., hacking, linux, soldering, electrical engineering, reverse engineering, radio communications and so much more even within those disicplines.

Let's jump right in and start exploring.  If you ever have thoughts, questions, or suggestions, I'm here with an open mind.  Let's get hacking.
