Hello there! I'm Nathan. A penetration tester by trade, i've recently entered the world of hardware hacking, specifically related to IoT (Internet of Things). My background spans various industries and experience and I'm excited to share my journey. Hopefully you can learn along with me and of course, teach me things through this process.  I'm always open for comms and collaboration so don't hesitate to reach out!
