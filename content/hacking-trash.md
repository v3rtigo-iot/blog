Here I'll be sharing videos from my stream ***Hacking Trashing*** where we take devices that I've found at thift stores (or that my coworkers send me), and attempt to hack them, or at the very least identify interesting stuff!  I've found this to be amazing practice as often these devices are older, insecure, and useful for easily identifying serial interfaces.
